# heart_stroke_prediction_app
A Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the risk of stroke using health and lifestyle parameters.
This project includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and an interactive prediction app.

Features
 Predicts stroke risk based on medical + lifestyle inputs
 Machine Learning pipeline (preprocessing → model training → deployment)
 Built using Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit/Flask (edit accordingly)
 Easy-to-use user interface
 Well-structured notebook explaining entire workflow

 Machine Learning Workflow
1️ Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical features
Standardization / normalization
Feature selection
Removing noise/outliers (if applied)

2️ Model Development
Models tested (customize if needed):
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
SVM
Best model saved as model.pkl.

3. Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
ROC-AUC
